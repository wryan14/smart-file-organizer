## Batch Processing

Smart Organizer supports batch processing to improve efficiency:

1. Run the batch processor:
   ```
   python smart_organizer.py batch
   ```

2. Add files to the queue:
   - Enter file paths one by one
   - Provide a brief description for each
   - Type 'done' when finished adding files

3. Process all files at once:
   - The AI will generate names for all files in a single request
   - Review and select which suggestions to apply
   - Apply changes in bulk

This dramatically speeds up the workflow by reducing the number of API calls and waiting time.

## Naming Patterns

By default, Smart Organizer uses these naming patterns:

- **Files**: `{year}-{month}-{category}_{descriptor}_{context}.ext`
- **Directories**: `{year}-{month}-{category}_{purpose}`

For example:
- `2023-06-finance_quarterly-report_q2.xlsx`
- `2023-06-project_website-redesign`

These patterns can be customized in the configuration.

## Directory Registry

Smart Organizer maintains a registry of known directories to help with organization. You can:

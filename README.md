## üí° Common Workflows

### Workflow 1: Organizing Individual Files

Ideal for handling important documents that need careful organization:

```bash
python smart_organizer.py file /path/to/quarterly_report.pdf
```

1. The tool shows you a preview of the file content
2. You provide a brief description (e.g., "Q2 financial report with performance metrics")
3. AI suggests a standardized name (e.g., "2025-03-finance_quarterly-report_q2.pdf")
4. AI recommends an appropriate directory based on your existing structure
5. You approve or modify each suggestion
6. The file is renamed and moved

### Workflow 2: Cleaning Up a Directory

Perfect for organizing folders with mixed content:

```bash
python smart_organizer.py dir /path/to/messy_downloads
```

1. The tool analyzes the directory content
2. You provide a description of the directory's purpose
3. AI suggests a standardized name for the directory
4. You can choose to process all files within the directory:
   - With the same description (batch mode)
   - Individually with custom descriptions

### Workflow 3: Batch Processing Similar Files

Efficient for handling multiple related files:

```bash
python smart_organizer.py batch
```

1. Add multiple files to the processing queue
2. Provide descriptions for each
3. Process all files at once
4. Review AI suggestions for each file
5. Apply changes in bulk

## üìã File Naming Patterns

Smart Organizer uses consistent naming patterns:

**Files**: `{year}-{month}-{category}_{descriptor}_{context}.ext`
- Example: `2025-03-project_website-redesign_homepage.psd`

**Directories**: `{year}-{month}-{category}_{purpose}`
- Example: `2025-03-marketing_social-media-campaign`

*These patterns can be customized in the configuration.*

## üîç Command Reference
